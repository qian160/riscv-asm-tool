# #riscv-asm-tool
​		translate your asm code to pure machine code. 
steps to use

          1. write your asm code in test.s
          2. make run. and the machine code will be printed to your shell. you can also redirect it to some files(read makefile)

​		The source code is in as.cpp, which is very straightforward and easy. If you find any bugs,  you could read the code and try to fix it on your own. This works fine for me so far. I hope this could give you some help
