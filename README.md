# riscv-asm-tool
translate your asm code to pure machine code. 
steps to use
       1. write your asm code in test.s
       2. make run. and the machine code will be printed to your shell. you can also redirect it to some files
       
       I'm not sure if there exists any bug....But it works fine for me so far! And since the source code is in as.cpp, you could try to solve the bug yourself. The code is pretty easy:D
       Hope this can give you some help
